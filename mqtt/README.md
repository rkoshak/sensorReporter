| `Keepalive`   | X        | Seconds                         | How frequently to exchange keep alive messages with the broker. The smaller the number the faster the broker will detect this client has gone offline but the more network traffic will be consumed. |
| `RootTopic`   | X        | Valid MQTT topic, no wild cards | Serves as the root topic for all the messages published. For example, if an RpiGpioSensor has a destination "back-door", the actual topic published to will be `<RootTopic>/back-door`.              |
| `TLS`         |          | Boolean                         | If set to `True`, will use TLS encryption in the connection to the MQTT broker.                                                                                                                      |

| `TLSinsecure` |          | Boolean                         | Optional parameter to disable verification of the server hostname in the server certificate. Default is `False`.                                                                                   |

There are two hard coded topics the Connection will use:

- `<RootTopic>/status`: the LWT topic; "ONLINE" will be published when the MQTT connection is established and "OFFLINE" published when disconnecting and as the LWT message.
- `<RootTopic>/refresh`: any message received on this topic will cause the sensor_reporter to immediately publish the most recent sensor readings. Note: it does not actually go out to the device, it only reports the most recent reading.

### Actuator / sensor relevant parameters

To use an actuator or a sensor (a device) with a connection, it has to define this in the device `Connections:` parameter with a dictionary of connection names and connection related parameters (see Dictionary of connectors layout).
The MQTT connection uses following parameters:

| Parameter    | Required          | Restrictions | Purpose                                                                                                           |
|--------------|-------------------|--------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `CommandSrc` | yes for actuators |              | Specifies the topic to subscribe for actuator events                                                              |
| `StateDest`  |                   |              | Return topic to publish the current device state / sensor readings. If not present the state won't get published. |
| `Retain`     |                   | Boolean      | If True, MQTT will publish messages with the retain flag. Default is False.                                       |

#### Dictionary of connectors layout
To configure a MQTT connection in a sensor / actuator use following layout:

```yaml
Connections:
    <connection_name>:
        <sensor_output_1>:
            CommandSrc: <some topic>
            StateDest: <some other topic>
        <sensor_output_2>:
            CommandSrc: <some topic
            StateDest: <some other topic2>
            Retain: <as you choose>
    <connection_name2>:
        #etcetera
```
The available outputs are described at the sensor / actuator readme.

Some sensor / actuators have only a single output / input so the sensor_output section is not necessary:

```yaml
Connections:
    <connection_name>:
        CommandSrc: <some topic>
        StateDest: <some other topic>
```

#### Trigger disconnect / reconnect actions
This connection supports triggering actions on disconnect / reconnect for actuators and storing sensor readings while the connection is offline and sending them all at once on reconnect for sensors.
These options are configured for each device and are defined within the device's `Connections:` parameter. 

##### Actuator related parameters:
Can be defined within the `ConnectionOnDisconnect:` and `ConnectionOnReconnect:` parameter.

| Parameter         | Required            | Restrictions               | Purpose                                                                                                                                           |
|-------------------|---------------------|----------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `ChangeState`     |                     | Boolean                    | Trigger actuator state change on disconnect/reconnect (default = no)                                                                              |
| `TargetState`     | if ChangeState: yes | String in single 'quotes'  | The command to send to the actuator when the trigger occurs. Make sure the data type matches the actuator and use single 'quotes'                 |
| `ResumeLastState` |                     | Boolean, only on reconnect | If yes, the actuator will return to the last known state state on reconnection. Only works on actuators with return topic feature (default = no)  |

```yaml
Connections:
    <connection_name>:
        # actuator topic config omitted
        ConnectionOnDisconnect:
            ChangeState: < yes / no >
            # some value the actuator supports, could be also '0,0,100' for a  PWM dimmer
            TargetState: 'ON'
        ConnectionOnReconnect:
            ChangeState: < yes / no >
            TargetState: 'OFF'
            ResumeLastState: < yes / no >
```

##### Sensor related Parameters
Can be defined within the `ConnectionOnReconnect:` parameter.

| Parameter          | Required | Restrictions | Purpose                                                                                                               |
|--------------------|----------|--------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------        |
| `SendReadings`     |          | Boolean      | If yes, sensors readings will be collected while connection is offline and send when reconnected (default = no)       |
| `NumberOfReadings` |          | Integer      | Number of readings to be collected. Will be sent in the same order after reconnection, oldest first (default = 1 )    |

```yaml
Connections:
    <connection_name>:
        # sensor topic config omitted
        ConnectionOnReconnect:
            SendReadings: < yes / no >
            NumberOfReadings: < whole number >
```

## Homie Connection

A connection to communicate via MQTT using the [Homie convention](https://homieiot.github.io/#), making the sensors and actuators auto discoverable by the home automation software e. g. openHAB.

### Dependencies

MQTT Communication is handled using the [phao-mqtt](https://pypi.org/project/paho-mqtt/) library.
The Homie conventions is implemented via [homie-spec](https://pypi.org/project/homie-spec/).

```bash
cd /srv/sensorReporter
sudo ./install_dependencies.sh mqtt
```

There are two hard coded topics the Connection will use:

- `connection status`: the LWT topic; "ONLINE" will be published when the MQTT connection is established and "OFFLINE" published when disconnecting and as the LWT message.
- `refresh sensor readings`: any message received on this topic will cause the sensor_reporter to immediately publish the most recent sensor readings. Note: it does not actually go out to the device, it only reports the most recent reading.

### Actuator / sensor relevant parameters

To use an actuator or a sensor (a device) with a connection it has to define this in the device 'Connections:' parameter with a dictionary of connection names and connection related parameters (see Dictionary of connectors layout).
The Homie connection uses following parameters:

| `Name`    | X        | a-Z, 0-9, "-", "_" | Specifies the visible name for the device                                                                                                                                                                          |
| `Type`    |          |                    | Type of the device (homie node, see $type in [Node Attributes](https://homieiot.github.io/specification/#node-attributes)), might change the behavior of the smart home server. (default value is empty string '') |

#### Dictionary of connectors layout
To configure a Homie connection in a sensor / actuator use following layout:

```yaml
Connections:
    <connection_name>:
        Name: <device_name>
```

#### Trigger disconnect / reconnect actions
This connection supports triggering actions on disconnect / reconnect for actuators and storing sensor readings while the connection is offline and sending them all at once on reconnect for sensors.
These options are configured for each device and are defined within the device's `Connections:` parameter. 

##### Actuator related parameters:
Can be defined within the `ConnectionOnDisconnect:` and `ConnectionOnReconnect:` parameter.

| Parameter         | Required            | Restrictions               | Purpose                                                                                                                                           |
|-------------------|---------------------|----------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `ChangeState`     |                     | Boolean                    | Trigger actuator state change on disconnect/reconnect (default = no)                                                                              |
| `TargetState`     | if ChangeState: yes | String in single 'quotes'  | The command to send to the actuator when the trigger occurs. Make sure the data type matches the actuator and use single 'quotes'                 |
| `ResumeLastState` |                     | Boolean, only on reconnect | If yes, the actuator will return to the last known state state on reconnection. Only works on actuators with return topic feature (default = no)  |

```yaml
Connections:
    <connection_name>:
        # actuator topic config omitted
        ConnectionOnDisconnect:
            ChangeState: < yes / no >
            # some value the actuator supports, could be also '0,0,100' for a  PWM dimmer
            TargetState: 'ON'
        ConnectionOnReconnect:
            ChangeState: < yes / no >
            TargetState: 'OFF'
            ResumeLastState: < yes / no >
```

##### Sensor related Parameters
Can be defined within the `ConnectionOnReconnect:` parameter.

| Parameter          | Required | Restrictions | Purpose                                                                                                               |
|--------------------|----------|--------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------        |
| `SendReadings`     |          | Boolean      | If yes, sensors readings will be collected while connection is offline and send when reconnected (default = no)       |
| `NumberOfReadings` |          | Integer      | Number of readings to be collected. Will be sent in the same order after reconnection, oldest first (default = 1 )    |

```yaml
Connections:
    <connection_name>:
        # sensor topic config omitted
        ConnectionOnReconnect:
            SendReadings: < yes / no >
            NumberOfReadings: < whole number >
```
